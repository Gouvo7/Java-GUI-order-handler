# Java-GUI-order-handler
This is a simple application written in Java where you can handle some data about orders. This was a final project requested from our teacher.
The code could be split apart in more files, but for the time being, our teacher told us not to do so. 

In this app, you can create orders, save them, read orders from a file or show statistics from the data collected. Shortcut info are included in the "Information" button.
The About button will show you a text in Greek, there is pretty much no reason for it to be there.
